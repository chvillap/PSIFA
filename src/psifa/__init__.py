PSIFA (Pattern Search and Implicit Filtering Algorithm) is a derivative-free
optimization algorithm that has been designed for linearly constrained problems
with noise in the objective function. It combines some elements of the pattern
search approach of Lewis and Torczon (2000) with ideas from the implicit
filtering method of Kelley (2011).
